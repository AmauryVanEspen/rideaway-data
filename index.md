Introducing the Brussels bike data team
During the month of July 2017 three students, guided by expert coaches, worked on an OpenStreetMap (OSM) focused project. The result of is a web tool that supports the Belgian OSM community by assisting them to identify missing map data on the regional cycling network of Brussels. 

Our end goal: supporting Brussels bike data completeness and correctness on OSM 

Comparing Brussels’ government reference cycling network open data with OSM
Visually presenting areas in OSM that doesn’t match to the Brussels data on an interactive and dynamic website

The open Summer of code, an initiative of Open Knowledge Belgium, is a one-month programme which gives technology, design, and communications students the chance to transform open innovation projects into real-world applications. At the 7th edition of oSoc a total of 40 students are working on 10 cutting-edge projects build on open source code.
