Brussels Mobility 1 - Data validation and integration into OpenStreetMap

Brussels Mobility has planned a bicycle network with routes they believe are the best for cycling around in Brussels. To make this data available to the public, it should be published on the open platform OpenStreetMap so it is available for use by cycling applications. The OpenStreetMap community does this mapping process manually to ensure a high level of quality and detail.

This tool supports the community in this mapping process of the cycling network of Brussels, by identifying missing or incomplete routes and routes with wrong metadata.

## Installation
* Install Python version 2
* Install the following dependencies with `pip`:
  - django:  `pip install django`
  - geojson: `pip install geojson`
  - pyproj: `pip install pyproj`
* Install the PyOsmium library from [here](https://github.com/osmcode/pyosmium)
* Run the `install.sh` script or install following software manually:
  - flatpak: `apt install flatpak`
  - mono-devel: `apt install mono-devel`
  - monodevelop: `flatpak install --user --from https://download.mono-project.com/repo/monodevelop.flatpakref`

The webtool can be started by running the Django development server or by setting up a web server like Apache or NGINX. To run the script periodically, a cron job should be set-up to run `main.py` (e.g. every 15 minutes).

## Server
The server can currently be visited at https://cyclenetworks.osm.be/
